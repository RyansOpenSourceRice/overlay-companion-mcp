# Overlay Companion MCP - UX/UI Testing Guide

## User Perspective Testing - Real World Scenario

This guide tests the Overlay Companion MCP from a **real user's perspective** - someone with:
- Fedora Desktop (host) with Cherry AI and Firefox
- Fedora VM (guest) for testing
- No Python coding experience
- Wants GUI-based configuration

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Check: Are You Ready?

**Your Setup:**
- ✅ Fedora Desktop with Cherry AI installed
- ✅ Firefox browser
- ✅ Fedora VM (VirtualBox, VMware, Proxmox, or KVM)
- ✅ Network connectivity between host and VM

**You are READY to proceed!**

---

## Phase 1: Documentation Review (Before Installation)

### Test 1.1: First Impressions - README.md

**What to check:**
1. Open the GitHub repository: https://github.com/RyansOpenSourceRice/overlay-companion-mcp
2. Read the README.md

**Questions to answer:**
- [ ] Can you understand what this project does in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is the architecture diagram clear?
- [ ] Are the installation steps obvious?
- [ ] Do you know which installation method to use?

**Expected User Journey:**
```
User reads: "AI-powered screen overlay system with MCP integration"
User sees: Architecture diagram showing Host → Containers → VM
User finds: "Option A: KasmVNC Setup (Recommended)"
User thinks: "Okay, I'll use KasmVNC"
```

**UX Issues to Note:**
- ❓ Is "KasmVNC" explained before it's recommended?
- ❓ Is the difference between "Host" and "VM" clear?
- ❓ Are there too many options (Option A, Option B, custom ports)?

---

### Test 1.2: Installation Instructions Clarity

**What to check:**
Read the installation section carefully.

**Questions:**
- [ ] Do you know where to run each command (host vs VM)?
- [ ] Are the curl commands safe to run?
- [ ] Is it clear what gets installed?
- [ ] Are there screenshots or visual guides?

**Expected User Journey:**
```
Step 1: Run on HOST: curl -fsSL ... | bash
Step 2: Create VM (optional)
Step 3: Run on VM: curl -fsSL ... | bash
Step 4: Connect them together
```

**UX Issues to Note:**
- ❓ "Optional" VM - but is it really optional?
- ❓ What if the user already has a VM?
- ❓ What if port 8080 is already in use?

---

## Phase 2: Installation Testing (Hands-On)

### Test 2.1: Host Installation (Your Fedora Desktop)

**Action:** Install on your Fedora Desktop

```bash
# On your Fedora Desktop (HOST)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyansOpenSourceRice/overlay-companion-mcp/main/scripts/host-setup-kasmvnc.sh | bash
```

**What to observe:**
- [ ] Does the script explain what it's doing?
- [ ] Does it check for prerequisites?
- [ ] Does it handle port conflicts gracefully?
- [ ] Does it show progress indicators?
- [ ] Does it provide next steps at the end?

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Installing Overlay Companion MCP (KasmVNC)...
✅ Checking prerequisites...
✅ Installing podman...
✅ Pulling container images...
✅ Starting services...
✅ Installation complete!

Next steps:
1. Access web interface: http://localhost:8080
2. Set up VM with: curl -fsSL ... | bash
```

**UX Issues to Note:**
- ❓ Does it explain what podman is?
- ❓ Does it ask for confirmation before installing?
- ❓ Does it handle errors gracefully?
- ❓ Does it provide a way to uninstall?

---

### Test 2.2: VM Installation (Your Fedora VM)

**Action:** Install on your Fedora VM

```bash
# SSH into your Fedora VM or open terminal in VM
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyansOpenSourceRice/overlay-companion-mcp/main/scripts/vm-setup-kasmvnc.sh | bash
```

**What to observe:**
- [ ] Does it explain what KasmVNC is?
- [ ] Does it configure the desktop environment?
- [ ] Does it provide the connection URL?
- [ ] Does it start services automatically?

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Installing KasmVNC on VM...
✅ Installing desktop environment...
✅ Configuring KasmVNC...
✅ Starting services...
✅ Installation complete!

KasmVNC is running on: http://VM_IP:6901
```

**UX Issues to Note:**
- ❓ Does it tell you the VM's IP address?

3. **Stop MCP server** - Does the UI show degraded state?
4. **Network timeout** - Does it retry gracefully?

**Expected Error Messages:**
```
❌ Connection Failed
   Unable to connect to VM at 192.168.1.100:6901
   
   Possible causes:
   • VM is not running
   • KasmVNC service is stopped
   • Firewall blocking port 6901
   • Incorrect IP address
   
   [Retry] [Edit Connection] [View Logs]
